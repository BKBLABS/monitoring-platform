# Monitoring and Alerting Platform

## Overview

This application is a monitoring platform designed to collect metrics from a custom application (`hyphenmon`) and a Zabbix instance. It aggregates this data, stores it in a MySQL database, correlates the data, detects anomalies based on predefined rules, and sends out alerts.

## How it Works

The platform consists of several key components:

1.  **`hyphenmon` (Mock Application Metrics):**
    *   A Flask-based web application ([`hyphenmon/app.py`](/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/hyphenmon/app.py)).
    *   Exposes an API endpoint (`/metrics`) that provides mock application metrics, including `timestamp`, `response_time_ms`, and `error_rate`.

2.  **`zabbix-connector` (Zabbix Data Collection):**
    *   A Python client ([`zabbix-connector/zabbix_client.py`](/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/zabbix-connector/zabbix_client.py)) for interacting with a Zabbix monitoring system.
    *   Used to fetch item data from Zabbix.

3.  **`data-aggregator` (Data Collection and Storage):**
    *   A Python script ([`data-aggregator/aggregator.py`](/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/data-aggregator/aggregator.py)).
    *   Fetches data from `hyphenmon`'s `/metrics` endpoint.
    *   Uses the `zabbix-connector` to fetch data from Zabbix.
    *   Aggregates these two data sources.
    *   Stores the aggregated data into a MySQL database (as per recent modifications to `aggregator.py`).

4.  **MySQL Database (Data Persistence):**
    *   Serves as the central repository for storing time-series data from both `hyphenmon` and Zabbix.

5.  **`correlator` (Data Correlation):**
    *   A Python module ([`correlator/correlate.py`](/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/correlator/correlate.py)).
    *   Designed to take data (which would now be fetched from the MySQL database) from Zabbix and `hyphenmon` and correlate them based on their timestamps. If timestamps are within a defined window (e.g., 10 seconds), the data points are considered related.

6.  **`anomaly-detector` (Anomaly Detection):**
    *   A Python script ([`anomaly-detector/detect.py`](/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/anomaly-detector/detect.py)).
    *   Analyzes the correlated data (fetched from MySQL and processed by the `correlator`).
    *   Currently, it checks if the `hyphenmon` error rate exceeds a threshold (e.g., 0.5) and generates an alert message.

7.  **`alerting-system` (Notification):**
    *   A Python module ([`alerting-system/alert.py`](/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/alerting-system/alert.py)).
    *   Sends alerts (e.g., via email using SMTP) when anomalies are detected by the `anomaly-detector`.

**Data Flow (with MySQL integration):**
1. `hyphenmon` generates metrics.
2. `zabbix-connector` is used by the aggregator to fetch Zabbix data.
3. `data-aggregator` collects data from `hyphenmon` and Zabbix, then stores it in the MySQL Database.
4. A separate process/script would then:
    a. Fetch relevant data from the MySQL Database.
    b. Use the `correlator` module to find related data points.
    c. Pass correlated data to the `anomaly-detector`.
    d. If anomalies are found, use the `alerting-system` to send notifications.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.7+
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   A running Zabbix instance.
*   A running MySQL server.
*   Git (for cloning the repository).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url> # Replace <your-repository-url> with the actual URL
cd monitoring-platform-main
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

It's highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install Flask requests mysql-connector-python
```

Consider creating a `requirements.txt` file for your project:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
# Then, others can install using: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure MySQL Database

1.  Connect to your MySQL server using a MySQL client.
2.  Create a database for the monitoring platform (e.g., `monitoring_db`).

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE monitoring_db;
    USE monitoring_db;
    ```

3.  Create the necessary tables. Below are example schemas. You may need to adjust them based on the exact data you intend to store.

    **For `hyphenmon` metrics:**

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE hyphenmon_metrics (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        timestamp BIGINT,
        response_time_ms INT,
        error_rate FLOAT,
        recorded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

    **For Zabbix items:** (This is a simplified example based on the `item.get` Zabbix API call. Adapt fields as needed.)

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE zabbix_items (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        itemid VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE, -- Assuming itemid is unique
        name VARCHAR(255),
        lastvalue TEXT,
        lastclock BIGINT,
        hostid VARCHAR(255), -- If you store which host it belongs to
        recorded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
    ```

### 4. Configure Application Components

*   **`data-aggregator/aggregator.py`**:
    *   Open the file [`data-aggregator/aggregator.py`](/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/data-aggregator/aggregator.py).
    *   Update the MySQL connection details in the `store_in_mysql` function:

        ````python
        // filepath: /Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/data-aggregator/aggregator.py
        // ...existing code...
        def store_in_mysql(data):
            # Replace with your MySQL connection details
            mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
                host="your_mysql_host",      # e.g., "localhost" or IP address
                user="your_mysql_user",
                password="your_mysql_password",
                database="monitoring_db"  # Or your chosen DB name from step 3
            )
        // ...existing code...
        ````

    *   Update Zabbix connection details where `ZabbixClient` is instantiated in the `aggregate` function:

        ````python
        // filepath: /Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/data-aggregator/aggregator.py
        // ...existing code...
        def aggregate():
            zabbix = ZabbixClient("http://your_zabbix_server_ip/api_jsonrpc.php", "YourZabbixAdminUser", "YourZabbixPassword") # Update these
            z_data = zabbix.get_items("10105") # Ensure this hostid is correct for your Zabbix setup
        // ...existing code...
        ````

*   **`alerting-system/alert.py`**:
    *   Open the file [`alerting-system/alert.py`](/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/alerting-system/alert.py).
    *   Configure your SMTP server details and email credentials in the `send_alert` function:

        ````python
        // filepath: /Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/alerting-system/alert.py
        // ...existing code...
        def send_alert(subject, body):
            msg = f"Subject: {subject}\n\n{body}"
            server = smtplib.SMTP("your_smtp_server_host", 587) # e.g., "smtp.gmail.com" and port 587 or 465 for SSL
            server.starttls() # Use if your server supports STARTTLS
            # If using SSL directly: server = smtplib.SMTP_SSL("your_smtp_server_host", 465)
            server.login("your_email_address@example.com", "your_email_password")
            server.sendmail("your_email_address@example.com", "recipient_email_address@example.com", msg)
            server.quit()
        ````

### 5. Running the Application

The application components can be run as follows:

1.  **Start `hyphenmon` (Mock Metrics Service):**
    This service provides mock metrics for the aggregator.
    Open a terminal, navigate to the project root, and run:

    ```bash
    python hyphenmon/app.py
    ```

    This will typically start the service on `http://localhost:5001`.

2.  **Run `data-aggregator` (Collect and Store Data):**
    This script fetches data from `hyphenmon` and Zabbix, then stores it in your MySQL database. You'll likely want to run this periodically (e.g., using `cron` on Linux/macOS or Task Scheduler on Windows).
    To run it manually:

    ```bash
    python data-aggregator/aggregator.py
    ```

3.  **Processing and Alerting (Correlator, Anomaly Detector, Alerter):**
    The modules `correlator.py`, `detect.py`, and `alert.py` contain functions for these tasks. To make them work with the data now stored in MySQL, you would typically create a new Python script (e.g., `main_processor.py` in the project root) that orchestrates these steps:
    *   This script would:
        1.  Connect to the MySQL database.
        2.  Fetch recent data from the `hyphenmon_metrics` and `zabbix_items` tables. The logic for "recent" and how to pair records will depend on your specific correlation needs.
        3.  Pass the fetched data (appropriately formatted) to the `correlate` function from [`correlator/correlate.py`](/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/correlator/correlate.py).
        4.  Pass the output of the correlation to the `detect_anomalies` function from [`anomaly-detector/detect.py`](/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/anomaly-detector/detect.py).
        5.  If any alerts are generated, use the `send_alert` function from [`alerting-system/alert.py`](/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/alerting-system/alert.py) to send them.
    *   This `main_processor.py` script would also need to be run periodically, typically after the `data-aggregator` has had a chance to collect new data.

    **Conceptual structure for `main_processor.py` (you will need to implement the details):**

    ````python
    # main_processor.py (This is a new file you would create)
    import mysql.connector
    from correlator.correlate import correlate
    from anomaly_detector.detect import detect_anomalies
    from alerting_system.alert import send_alert
    # You might need shared.time_utils if you implement time-based fetching

    def get_mysql_connection_details():
        return {
            "host": "your_mysql_host", # Same as in aggregator.py
            "user": "your_mysql_user",
            "password": "your_mysql_password",
            "database": "monitoring_db"
        }

    def fetch_recent_data(conn):
        cursor = conn.cursor(dictionary=True)
        # Example: Fetch last 2 minutes of hyphenmon data
        # Adjust time window and logic as needed
        query_hyphenmon = """
        SELECT timestamp, response_time_ms, error_rate 
        FROM hyphenmon_metrics 
        WHERE recorded_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL 2 MINUTE 
        ORDER BY timestamp DESC
        """
        cursor.execute(query_hyphenmon)
        hyphenmon_records = cursor.fetchall()

        # Example: Fetch last 2 minutes of Zabbix data
        query_zabbix = """
        SELECT itemid, name, lastvalue, lastclock 
        FROM zabbix_items 
        WHERE recorded_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL 2 MINUTE 
        ORDER BY lastclock DESC
        """
        cursor.execute(query_zabbix)
        zabbix_records = cursor.fetchall()
        
        cursor.close()
        return zabbix_records, hyphenmon_records

    def process_data():
        db_config = get_mysql_connection_details()
        conn = None
        try:
            conn = mysql.connector.connect(**db_config)
            zabbix_data_list, hyphenmon_data_list = fetch_recent_data(conn)

            # Correlation logic will depend on how you want to pair records.
            # The current `correlate` function expects one Zabbix item and one Hyphenmon item.

            # This is a simplified example assuming you find a pair to correlate.
            
            if not hyphenmon_data_list or not zabbix_data_list:
                print("Not enough data fetched for correlation.")
                return

            # Example: Try to correlate the latest hyphenmon record with relevant Zabbix data
            # This logic needs to be robust. For simplicity, using the first fetched records.
            # The `correlate` function expects zabbix_data to be a list of dicts, and hyphenmon_data as a dict.
            # Ensure zabbix_data_list[0] and hyphenmon_data_list[0] are what you intend to correlate.
            
            # You'll need a more sophisticated way to pair Zabbix and Hyphenmon data for correlation.
            # For instance, iterate through hyphenmon_data_list and for each, find a Zabbix item
            # within the 10-second window.
            
            # Simplified example:
            if hyphenmon_data_list and zabbix_data_list:
                # The correlate function expects zabbix_data to be a list containing the item to correlate
                # and hyphenmon_data to be a single dictionary.
                # This is a placeholder for your actual pairing logic.
                # You might iterate and call correlate for each potential pair.
                
                # Let's assume you've selected one h_data and one z_data for correlation
                # For example, the most recent ones:
                h_data_to_correlate = hyphenmon_data_list[0] # A dict
                # The zabbix_data for correlate needs to be a list containing the zabbix item dict
                z_data_to_correlate = [zabbix_data_list[0]] # A list with one dict

                print(f"Attempting to correlate: Zabbix item (clock {z_data_to_correlate[0].get('lastclock')}) and Hyphenmon item (ts {h_data_to_correlate.get('timestamp')})")
                correlated_output = correlate(z_data_to_correlate, h_data_to_correlate)

### 6. Grafana Dashboard (Optional)

The repository includes a Grafana dashboard configuration at [`dashboard/zabbix_dashboard.json`](/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/dashboard/zabbix_dashboard.json). This dashboard will be configured to work with MySQL.

To use it with your MySQL setup:

1. Ensure Grafana is installed and running.
2. In Grafana, add a new data source:
   * Go to Configuration (gear icon) -> Data Sources.
   * Click "Add data source".
   * Search for and select "MySQL".
   * Configure the connection details for your MySQL database (`monitoring_db`):
     * Host: `your_mysql_host:3306` (or your MySQL host and port)
     * Database: `monitoring_db`
     * User: `your_mysql_user`
     * Password: `your_mysql_password`
     * You can leave "TLS/SSL Mode" as `disable` unless your MySQL requires SSL.
   * Click "Save & Test". You should see a "Database Connection OK" message.
3. Import the dashboard:
   * In Grafana, navigate to Dashboards -> Import.
   * Upload the `zabbix_dashboard.json` file or paste its JSON content.
   * During the import process, Grafana will ask you to map the data source. Select your newly configured MySQL data source.
4. Modify Panel Queries:
   * The queries within the dashboard panels will need to be updated to fetch data from your MySQL tables (`hyphenmon_metrics`, `zabbix_items`) using MySQL-compatible SQL syntax.
   * For example, a simple query for `hyphenmon_metrics` might be:

     ```sql
     SELECT 
       CAST(timestamp AS SIGNED) AS time_sec, -- Grafana expects time in seconds or as datetime
       response_time_ms, 
       error_rate 
     FROM hyphenmon_metrics 
     WHERE $__timeFilter(recorded_at) -- Grafana macro for time range based on 'recorded_at'
     ORDER BY recorded_at DESC;
     ```

   * And for `zabbix_items` (example showing CPU load, adjust `name` as needed):

     ```sql
     SELECT
       CAST(lastclock AS SIGNED) AS time_sec, -- Grafana expects time in seconds or as datetime
       CAST(lastvalue AS FLOAT) AS cpu_load -- Assuming lastvalue is numeric for this item
     FROM zabbix_items
     WHERE name = 'CPU load' AND $__timeFilter(recorded_at) -- Filter by item name and Grafana time range
     ORDER BY recorded_at DESC;
     ```

   * You will need to edit each panel in the imported dashboard and adjust its query and visualization settings accordingly. The existing `zabbix_dashboard.json` is a Zabbix-specific export and might require significant changes to panel queries and types to work well with the direct MySQL data. It might be easier to create a new dashboard from scratch in Grafana, adding panels and querying your MySQL tables directly.

## Running and Testing the Application

Follow these steps to run and test the application:

1.  **Configure `main_processor.py`**:
    *   Open `/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/main_processor.py`.
    *   **Crucially, update the placeholder values** for `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, and `MYSQL_DATABASE` with your actual MySQL connection details.
    *   If you want to test email alerting, also configure `SMTP_SERVER_HOST`, `SMTP_SERVER_PORT`, `SMTP_EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `SMTP_EMAIL_PASSWORD`, and `RECIPIENT_EMAIL_ADDRESS`. Then, uncomment the `send_alert` call within the `process_data` function in `main_processor.py`.

2.  **Configure `data-aggregator/aggregator.py`**:
    *   Ensure the MySQL connection details (host, user, password, database) and Zabbix connection details (URL, user, password, hostid) in `/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main/data-aggregator/aggregator.py` are also correctly set up as per the instructions in Section 4 of this README ("Configure Application Components").

3.  **Set up MySQL Database and Tables**:
    *   If you haven't already, connect to your MySQL server and run the `CREATE DATABASE` and `CREATE TABLE` SQL commands provided in Section 3 of this README ("Configure MySQL Database").

4.  **Start `hyphenmon`**:
    *   Open a new terminal in the `/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main` directory.
    *   Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (on macOS/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (on Windows).
    *   Run: `python hyphenmon/app.py`
    *   This should start the mock metrics service, typically on `http://localhost:5001`. Keep this terminal running.

5.  **Run `data-aggregator`**:
    *   Open another new terminal in `/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main`.
    *   Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (on macOS/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (on Windows).
    *   Run: `python data-aggregator/aggregator.py`
    *   This script will fetch data from `hyphenmon` and Zabbix (if configured and reachable) and store it in your MySQL database. Check the output for any errors. You can run this script a few times to populate some data.

6.  **Run `main_processor.py`**:
    *   Open a third new terminal in `/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main`.
    *   Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (on macOS/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (on Windows).
    *   Run: `python main_processor.py`
    *   This script will fetch the data from MySQL, attempt to correlate it, and check for anomalies. Observe the print statements for output on fetched data, correlations, and any detected anomalies.

7.  **Visualize in Grafana**:
    *   Follow the updated "Grafana Dashboard (Optional)" section in this README (Section 6).
    *   Ensure Grafana is running.
    *   Add your MySQL database as a data source in Grafana.
    *   You can try importing the `dashboard/zabbix_dashboard.json`, but as the README states, you'll likely need to **significantly edit the panel queries** to use your MySQL tables (`hyphenmon_metrics`, `zabbix_items`) and MySQL SQL syntax.
    *   Alternatively, create a new dashboard in Grafana and add panels, using the example SQL queries provided in the `README.md` as a starting point to query your `hyphenmon_metrics` and `zabbix_items` tables.

**Important Considerations for Testing:**

*   **Zabbix Instance**: The `zabbix-connector` and `data-aggregator` expect a running Zabbix instance. If you don't have one or it's not correctly configured in `data-aggregator/aggregator.py`, the Zabbix data fetching part will fail. The application can still partially work with just `hyphenmon` data if the Zabbix parts are handled gracefully (e.g., the `main_processor.py` can proceed if Zabbix data is empty but Hyphenmon data exists).
*   **Correlation Logic**: The correlation logic in `correlator/correlate.py` and how it's used in `main_processor.py` is based on timestamps. You might need to adjust the `CORRELATION_WINDOW_SECONDS` in `main_processor.py` or refine the logic for your specific needs.
*   **Error Handling**: The provided scripts have basic error handling. For a production system, you'd want to make this more robust.
*   **Periodic Execution**: For continuous monitoring, `data-aggregator/aggregator.py` and `main_processor.py` would need to be run periodically (e.g., using cron jobs or a task scheduler).

3. **Set up MySQL Database and Tables:**
   * Connect to your MySQL server and run the `CREATE DATABASE` and `CREATE TABLE` SQL commands provided in Section 3 of this README

4. **Start `hyphenmon`:**
   * Open a new terminal in the `/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main` directory
   * Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (on macOS/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (on Windows)
   * Run: `python hyphenmon/app.py`
   * This should start the mock metrics service, typically on `http://localhost:5001`. Keep this terminal running

5. **Run `data-aggregator`:**
   * Open another new terminal in `/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main`
   * Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (on macOS/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (on Windows)
   * Run: `python data-aggregator/aggregator.py`
   * This script will fetch data from `hyphenmon` and Zabbix (if configured and reachable) and store it in your MySQL database. Check the output for any errors. You can run this script a few times to populate some data

6. **Run `main_processor.py`:**
   * Open a third new terminal in `/Users/swan/Documents/monitoring-platform-main`
   * Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (on macOS/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (on Windows)
   * Run: `python main_processor.py`
   * This script will fetch the data from MySQL, attempt to correlate it, and check for anomalies. Observe the print statements for output on fetched data, correlations, and any detected anomalies

7. **Visualize in Grafana:**
   * Follow the updated "Grafana Dashboard (Optional)" section in this README (Section 6)
   * Ensure Grafana is running
   * Add your MySQL database as a data source in Grafana
   * You can try importing the `dashboard/zabbix_dashboard.json`, but as the README states, you'll likely need to **significantly edit the panel queries** to use your MySQL tables (`hyphenmon_metrics`, `zabbix_items`) and MySQL SQL syntax
   * Alternatively, create a new dashboard in Grafana and add panels, using the example SQL queries provided in the `README.md` as a starting point to query your `hyphenmon_metrics` and `zabbix_items` tables

### Important Considerations for Testing

* **Zabbix Instance**: The `zabbix-connector` and `data-aggregator` expect a running Zabbix instance. If you don't have one or it's not correctly configured in `data-aggregator/aggregator.py`, the Zabbix data fetching part will fail. The application can still partially work with just `hyphenmon` data if the Zabbix parts are handled gracefully (e.g., the `main_processor.py` can proceed if Zabbix data is empty but Hyphenmon data exists)
* **Correlation Logic**: The correlation logic in `correlator/correlate.py` and how it's used in `main_processor.py` is based on timestamps. You might need to adjust the `CORRELATION_WINDOW_SECONDS` in `main_processor.py` or refine the logic for your specific needs
* **Error Handling**: The provided scripts have basic error handling. For a production system, you'd want to make this more robust
* **Periodic Execution**: For continuous monitoring, `data-aggregator/aggregator.py` and `main_processor.py` would need to be run periodically (e.g., using cron jobs or a task scheduler)
